## Disease context
Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progressive
form (MASH) are highly prevalent liver conditions associated with obesity, insulin
resistance, and dyslipidemia. Early-stage disease is often asymptomatic and difficult
to detect using routine clinical tests alone.

## Motivation
Definitive staging methods such as liver biopsy are invasive and not suitable for
population-level screening. There is a strong need for non-invasive, data-driven
approaches that can identify early molecular and clinical signals of disease risk
and progression.

## Project goal
The goal of this project is to build a small, reproducible prototype that demonstrates:
- Quality control and analysis of RNA-seq data for biomarker discovery
- Integration of omics-derived features with routine clinical biomarkers
- Use of machine learning and a simple deep learning model for risk classification
- Application of explainability techniques to interpret model outputs
- Considerations for population-specific model adaptation

## Scope
This is an educational and exploratory project using public or simulated data,
designed to demonstrate end-to-end bioinformatics and AI workflows rather than
clinical deployment.
